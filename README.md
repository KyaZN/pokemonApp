pokemonApp

The development of this app will encounter the following:

Testing:

1. Coding standards
2. Best practices
3. Authenticity
4. Complexity (optimal code)
5. Effective use of data structures
6. Re-useability of code
7. Innovation

Task to do : 
-   one endpoint, /pokemon
-   Allow one endpoint to be filtered / sorted with parameters
-   Develop a Python script to import the data into a (SQLite) database.
-   Add authentication (any)
-   Some form of simple test

Notes:
-    Any library (next to flask) is allowed .
-    keep it simple.
-    Make sure your code is clean.
-    Make sure you include your git history in the zip file.
-    You should use Flask and Python (Important!)

Phases:
1. Creating basic elements HTML
2. Create the model for SQLite DB
3. Generate Functionality to objects (CRUD)
4. Generate process to import from csv to DB
5. Adding plus funtionality
6. Enhance design
7. Enjoy it!
